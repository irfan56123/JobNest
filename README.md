## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed on your computer:

- [Node.js v18+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) account

---

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tehan1510/JobNest.git
cd JobNest
```

---

### Step 2 — Set Up Environment Variables

Go into the `server` folder and create a file called `.env`:

```bash
cd server
```

Create a new file named `.env` and paste this inside:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
JWT_SECRET=any_random_secret_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

> **Where to get these values:**
>
> - `MONGO_URI` → Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas), create a free cluster, click **Connect**, and copy the connection string. Replace `<password>` with your database password.
> - `JWT_SECRET` → Type any random string you want, e.g. `mysecretkey123`

---

### Step 3 — Install All Dependencies

Go back to the root folder and run one command to install everything:

```bash
cd ..
npm run install-all
```

This will install dependencies for the root, server, and client folders all at once.

---

### Step 4 — Run the App

From the root folder, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the frontend and backend at the same time.

| Service  | URL                   |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend  | http://localhost:5000 |

Open your browser and go to **http://localhost:3000**

---

## Available Commands

Run these from the **root folder**:

| Command               | Description                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`         | Start both frontend and backend together             |
| `npm run server`      | Start backend only                                   |
| `npm run client`      | Start frontend only                                  |
| `npm run install-all` | Install all dependencies for root, server and client |
